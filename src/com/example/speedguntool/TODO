[ ]Allow data to be exported to a CSV file (<speed>, <time recorded>)
[*]Make text fields easier to read
[*]Consider adding / removing certain fields, e.g. adding "Highest speed" and "Percent speeding" or removing "Most popular speed"
[*]Add button to switch to displaying a graph in another Activity
[ ]Make the graph dynamically reflect the data put in
[ ]Allow user to record (and write to the output file) the location, weather, etc. via an activity that appears before the data entry activity
[*]Add a "Vehicle Type" button? We can have three add buttons, each one for a specific vehicle. This would be instead of a seperate vehicle button.
[*]When an invalid speed is entered, have some toast pop up instead of a dialog box
[ ]Use trigonometry to calculate the actual speed of oncoming traffic, based on the user's measured speed and his/her angle with respect to traffic?
